Frontend for C, concentrating on: generation from code; single-file analysis; modification; and emission (to C code).

Use-cases this is designed to support:

  - Generate/update `free` calling `int cleanup_StructName(struct StructName*)` functions, e.g.:
      - `struct Foo { struct Bar *bar;}; struct Bar { int a; };` will generate:
      - `int cleanup_Bar(struct Bar*);` &
      - `int cleanup_Foo(struct Foo*);` (which internally will call `cleanup_Bar`)
  - With `fmt` of JSON, INI, YAML, TOML, &etc.:
    - Generate/update parsers  from `const char*` to `struct`: `const int StructName_<fmt>_parse(struct StructName*, const char*)` function;
    - Generate/update emitters from `struct` to `char*`: `const int StructName_<fmt>_emit(const struct StructName*, char*)` function;
  - Generate Google Cloud client library for C (with [Google Cloud API Discovery Service](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference) as input);
  - Generate arbitrary C client libraries (with [OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0) as input);
  - Generating `#pragma` for every function to expose them for calling from, e.g., [assembly](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.5.0?topic=programs-calling-c-code-from-assembler-c-example)

## Design

This C compiler has a very unusual design, the macro and C language are treated as one. The foci are:

  - location start/end of function, `struct`, and feature macros (e.g., `#ifdef JSON_EMIT` then `#endif /* JSON_EMIT */`);
  - `struct` fields.

…which enable a number of use-cases to be simply developed, e.g., see the list above.

### Drawbacks

  - Macros aren't evaluated, which means a simple `#define LBRACE {` will break cdd-c.
  - Like [`m4`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_(computer_language)), CMake, and other tools; cdd-c must be run before your code is built.
