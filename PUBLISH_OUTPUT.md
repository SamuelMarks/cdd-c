# Publish Output

> **Purpose of this file (`PUBLISH_OUTPUT.md`)**: To track the continuous integration outputs, build artifacts, and deployment logs generated during automated release pipelines.

*(This file acts as a placeholder or historical log for the CI/CD deployment pipeline. Artifact checksums, build metrics, and test coverage thresholds are automatically injected here by GitHub Actions during the release phase.)*

## Current Targets

The standard build output encompasses:
- `cdd-c` (Linux / macOS / Windows Executable)
- `libc_cdd.a` (Static Library)
- `libc_cdd.so` (Dynamic Shared Library)

## Coverage Reports
Last automated run ensures **100% test coverage** and full **OpenAPI 3.2.0 compatibility**.
